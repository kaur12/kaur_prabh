# Rock Paper Scissors in Python!
### A electronic take on a classic game!
#### Pick your weapon and play against the computer - you will only get a virtual sting if you lose!

Prerequisites: All you need is [Python](https://www.python.org/donwload/releases/3.0) to play.

Clone the project, navigate to the directory - <code>cd directoryname</code> - and run the game.py file in a Python3 Terminal Window for mac / linux.

The rules are the same as the classic game:

1. Paper covers Rock
2. Scissors cuts Paper
3. Rock smashes Scissors

Choose your weapon wisely!

 The computer chooses first; just [follow the promts].

 Built with [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/).

 Enjoy!
